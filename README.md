# Immerse

Immerse used to be a student run science and research magazine at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras. I was part of the editorial team for a few years during my PhD.

We interviewed professors and their research students from the different departments of the institute about one of their research projects. As writers and editors, we learnt a lot about different areas of research, _how_ this research was conducted, and how to explain very complicated and technical ideas to a general audience.

Here are e-copies of the editions of 2017, 2018, and 2019.
